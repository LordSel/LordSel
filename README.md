Well, like hello, I'm @LordSel or just Sel, it doesn't matter. So, I just opened a profile on Git to have it? Maybe so.
But I myself am a simple student and I want something that will help people or amuse them...
In general, I dreamed of releasing games and programs, but it’s really difficult and so I started scrolling information on Git, so who I?
I guess I just want to explore the Internet, programming and all that, phew, the world is difficult)
but I’m trying to cope with it, so I’ll go create a couple of private directories and start throwing information and developments there)))))))))))) 


(P.S. I am not a native English speaker and do not know it well, so I apologize for this letter (P.S.S all this text is taken from Google translator.))
